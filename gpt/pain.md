respond yes if you have read the above and remember the previous input

Yes

Kevin Mei
Something we're iterating on, but there are the leading value props we're experimenting with:

- Save time (connect directly to data sources -> don't spend time manually generating exports that are pasted into Excel; schedule workflows to run automatically -> don't spend time updating work, etc)
- Reduce errors (working across files with copy/paste -> risk of making an error; keeping up with different Excel templates that might have a formula mistake and are hard to audit; etc)
- We have support for Excel formulas and logic blocks (no learning curve, can use the things a finance/business person already knows; don't need to get support from engineering to set things up or maintain them, can handle on your own so you're working independently)

ICP:

- Outsource accountants (work with many clients - 5+ quickbooks logins, 5+ G-Suites, etc -> just create a few workflows and automate the work)
- Treasury (pulling data from many sources, complex formulas in Excel, large files that might break Excel or make it run slowly, etc)
- Head of finance at Series A-C companies (a lot to keep up with, probably have limited support maybe only a few people on team; can set up workflows to stay on top of things across the business)

respond yes if you have read this and all the previous input

Act as a product and marketing expert with expertise in finance and account. Based on the ICP and titles, create pain statements that can be tied back to emergent layer and which features can help solve the users’ pain.

Follow my instructions and follow them very carefully! Do not deviate away from my instructions!

1. Provide a step by step reasoning of why you're making the decisions you are making
   2.Avoid bad copy.
2. Avoid inaccuracies

Identifying pain points: I will consider the ICPs and their specific challenges and then map those challenges to features in the Emergent Layer that can help solve them.

Creating pain statements: For each identified pain point, I will craft a pain statement that highlights the problem and connects it to the Emergent Layer solution.

Step 1: Identifying pain points

For Outsource Accountants:

Pain Point 1: Managing multiple clients' data from various sources.
Pain Point 2: Time-consuming manual exports and updating work.
For Treasury:

Pain Point 1: Handling large, complex Excel files with intricate formulas.
Pain Point 2: Dealing with slow, potentially unstable Excel performance.
For Head of Finance at Series A-C companies:

Pain Point 1: Limited support and resources for handling finance tasks.
Pain Point 2: Staying on top of business performance across multiple data sources.
Step 2: Creating pain statements and tying them to Emergent Layer features

Outsource Accountants:
Pain Statement 1: "Struggling to efficiently manage multiple clients' data from various sources like QuickBooks and G-Suites?"
Emergent Layer Solution: Use the Data Source block to connect directly to multiple data sources, reducing the need for manual exports and increasing efficiency.

Pain Statement 2: "Tired of spending hours manually exporting and updating work for each client?"
Emergent Layer Solution: Schedule workflows to run automatically, saving time and minimizing errors.

Treasury:
Pain Statement 1: "Dealing with large, complex Excel files that are difficult to maintain and troubleshoot?"
Emergent Layer Solution: Leverage the Pivot Table, Add Column, and Data Validation blocks for better data management and organization, without the limitations of Excel.

Pain Statement 2: "Frustrated with slow, unstable Excel performance when working with extensive data?"
Emergent Layer Solution: Utilize Emergent Layer's robust platform, which is built to handle large datasets efficiently, without compromising performance.

Head of Finance at Series A-C companies:
Pain Statement 1: "Overwhelmed by finance tasks with limited support and resources?"
Emergent Layer Solution: Set up automated workflows to streamline processes and stay on top of business performance, all without needing additional support from engineering.

Pain Statement 2: "Stressed about managing data from multiple sources to stay informed on your company's performance?"
Emergent Layer Solution: Connect directly to various data sources using the Data Source block, enabling a comprehensive view of your company's performance without manual effort.

These pain statements emphasize the specific challenges faced by each ICP and demonstrate how Emergent Layer's features can help address their pain points effectively.
